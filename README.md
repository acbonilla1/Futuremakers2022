# Futuremakers2022


Day 1: It was very exciting to meet my team and community for this program! I am hopeful to continue learning about the many sectors of CS/Stem through Python and Machine Learning. It will take time to get used to working with Google Colab, but I have already learned of many new and important skills in this industry (NumPy, pandas, etc).
