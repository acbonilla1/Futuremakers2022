# Futuremakers2022


Day 1: It was very exciting to meet my team and community for this program! I am hopeful to continue learning about the many sectors of CS/Stem through Python and Machine Learning. It will take time to get used to working with Google Colab, but I have already learned of many new and important skills in this industry (NumPy, pandas, etc).

Day 2: I learned how data is processed/organized through different methods and models. It was interesting to begin understanding how a machine can learn, and how this is different from it being explicitly told what to do. I have learned a lot today, for instance, random forests and decision trees.

Day 3: I was able to see how much more information machine learning and deep learning have to offer. I learned about different ways to classify data as well as visualize its clusters/groupings. I have a stronger understanding of the different ways to go about not only clustering data into groups, but also splitting those different groups into separate sections through various methods. I'm beginning to learn the complexity of achieving accuracy in a model.

Day 4: I have been taught the importance of story telling. I understand the amount of power that one's words can have, and I hope to continue being aware of my wording in order to inspire others and bring them into my perspective. I also want to continue pointing out when I am being a leader, and acknowledge my accomplishments, as I tend to forget about these things with how fast life can move.

Day 5: Today I learned about many new and exciting parts of machine learning. I was allowed more depth into what constitutes a neural network, as well as practiced and witnessed the logic behind one. I think it's great that there are so many databases/libraries available for anyone to use, it makes me more hopeful in my ability to learn more about machine learning now and in the future despite it seeming like a daunting subject at times. I hope to learn more of the deeper details of the programming behind machine learning, but for now, I am happy working with easier tools such as TensorFlow and the MNIST & MNIST Fashion datasets.
