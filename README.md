# Futuremakers2022


Day 1: It was very exciting to meet my team and community for this program! I am hopeful to continue learning about the many sectors of CS/Stem through Python and Machine Learning. It will take time to get used to working with Google Colab, but I have already learned of many new and important skills in this industry (NumPy, pandas, etc).

Day 2: I learned how data is processed/organized through different methods and models. It was interesting to begin understanding how a machine can learn, and how this is different from it being explicitly told what to do. I have learned a lot today, for instance, random forests and decision trees.

Day 3: I was able to see how much more information machine learning and deep learning have to offer. I learned about different ways to classify data as well as visualize its clusters/groupings. I have a stronger understanding of the different ways to go about not only clustering data into groups, but also splitting those different groups into separate sections through various methods.
