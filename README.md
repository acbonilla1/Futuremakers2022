# Futuremakers2022


Day 1: It was very exciting to meet my team and community for this program! I am hopeful to continue learning about the many sectors of CS/Stem through Python and Machine Learning. It will take time to get used to working with Google Colab, but I have already learned of many new and important skills in this industry (NumPy, pandas, etc).

Day 2: I learned how data is processed/organized through different methods and models. It was interesting to begin understanding how a machine can learn, and how this is different from it being explicitly told what to do. I have learned a lot today, for instance, random forests and decision trees.

Day 3: I was able to see how much more information machine learning and deep learning have to offer. I learned about different ways to classify data as well as visualize its clusters/groupings. I have a stronger understanding of the different ways to go about not only clustering data into groups, but also splitting those different groups into separate sections through various methods. I'm beginning to learn the complexity of achieving accuracy in a model.

Day 4: I have been taught the importance of story telling. I understand the amount of power that one's words can have, and I hope to continue being aware of my wording in order to inspire others and bring them into my perspective. I also want to continue pointing out when I am being a leader, and acknowledge my accomplishments, as I tend to forget about these things with how fast life can move.

Day 5: Today I learned about many new and exciting parts of machine learning. I was allowed more depth into what constitutes a neural network, as well as practiced and witnessed the logic behind one. I think it's great that there are so many databases/libraries available for anyone to use, it makes me more hopeful in my ability to learn more about machine learning now and in the future despite it seeming like a daunting subject at times. I hope to learn more of the deeper details of the programming behind machine learning, but for now, I am happy working with easier tools such as TensorFlow and the MNIST & MNIST Fashion datasets.

Day 6: Today I solidified my understanding of neural networks. I feel confident in my ability to teach others of how a basic neural network works, and how one can be used for significant purposes. I am excited to continue learning both low-level and high-level parts of deep learning.

Day 7: Today I learned about Convolutional Neural Networks. They have been developed specifically for analyzing/classifying images, and I am excited to work with them in the future. I can already see many ways for this to help me in future projects, and I am hopeful to continue building my knowledge within deep learning and understand more intriguing/challenging topics that I might not have encountered in my life otherwise.

Day 8: Today I learned more about the different biases that can exist in an algorithm, and how to fight/limit them. It was interesting to realize how technology can still have human error, as well as connect to many societal issues that we face.

Day 9: Today I learned more about Convolutional Neural Networks and practiced making them. It is interesting to manually change values/layers in order to get the best possible accuracies in the testing stage.

Day 10: I learned about the many regression losses and classification losses that serve as loss functions. I am hopeful to practice using these in the future, as it is a lot to just memorize which ones are used for which situations.

Day 11: I learned how different activation functions are programmed, as well as their pros/cons. It's suprising how much thought can go into each and every layer inside of a neural network. There is a large amount of math constantly being utilized in this field of study, too.

Day 12: Today, I have learned many ways that biases can affect our lives. Not only from societal bias, but many other forms of it that I did not consider earlier. I believe that working to fight my own biases can help me not only create more inclusive products, but also develop new parts of a product that I might never have before. For instance, in creating a video game, I can sometimes limit myself to certain basic ideas of what I want it to look like. If I wanted to make an adventure game, I would include fighting and a story, but not all adventures games need to have either. I feel that it is this new thinking that will allow me to create more creative, innovative, and exciting things.

Day 13: Today I solidified my skills/knowledge pertaining to classifying images using machine learning. I feel more confident in my syntax and ability relating to basic neural networks.

Day 14: Today I learned more about underfitting/overfitting. I am more capable in identifying when my model is either underfitting or overfitting, as well as finding ways to mitigate this behavior.

Day 15: Today I learned about autoencoders. It was interesting to realize that there images can be encoded (compressed) into compressed representations, and then later decoded (expanded) back into their previous forms. The terminology still confuses me a bit, and so I plan to continue studying this topic more so that I can feel confident when talking about it!

Day 16: Today I learned about affective computing. It is definetely a field of study that I want to explore more in the future. It is difficult for even me to recognize when an audio clip is either panicked or happy (sometimes they can be both, in a way), so it is intriguing to think about how an algorithm can be made to distinguish between the two.

Day 17: Today I learned more about how Natural Language Processing works. I initially struggled to understand how tokenization and bag of words work, but eventually, I got the hang of it all. I hope to use NLP in the future in order to make an impressive form of a chatbot.

Day 18: Today I learned about Computer Vision. It connects to previous topics regarding image classification, but there were still many topics that I had not known about prior to today's notebook. For instance, style transfer. It's surprising to find out how such a complicated task can be moderately produced in a simple model. I am happy/proud to know that I can create many things that (even weeks ago) I would have thought to be far out of my abilities.
